Documentation For the Earth Lab Earth Data Science.org Learning Portal CI Pipeline
==================================================================================

Below you will find documentation for a CI Pipeline that we built at earth Lab.
This build automagically takes `Rmarkdown` and `Jupyter notebook` files, runs
them and then creates an output markdown file to be used in GitHub pages.

The build is in operation but needs considerable cleanup. All contributions are
welcome.
